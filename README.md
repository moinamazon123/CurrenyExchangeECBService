# Spring Boot - Foreign Exchange Rates Service #

### What is this repository for? ###

This is a simple exchange rate service exchanging EUR to any other currency provided by the European Central Bank
using up-to-date exchange rates. 

### How do I get set up? ###

There are two approaches: 

1. Intellij or Eclipse IDE: Open project as Maven project and start main class Application
2. Use maven and than run the service
   * Run in project dir: $ mvn clean install 
   * go to target dir and run: $ java -jar exchange-<VERSION>.jar

Optionally: Please make sure Lombok plugin is installed into Intellij IDE.

### How to use the service? ###

1. run application and go to http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
2. try api/rates/get/one endpoint via swagger or postman:

Example request:

  POST api/rates/get/one
  {
    "dateOfConversion": "2017-08-21",
    "targetCurrency": "USD"
  }

Date format is yyyy-MM-dd

Example response:

  {
    "targetCurrency": "USD",
    "rate": "1.1761",
    "date": "2017-08-21"
  }


Error codes (http status 400):

    INCORRECT_REQUEST_BODY(1000) - when sending wrong JSON
    
    DATE_WRONG_FORMAT(1001) - when using wrong date pattern
    
    ERROR_LOADING_ECB_DATA(1002) - when there is connection or unmarshalling problem with ECB
    
    NO_SUCH_DATE(1003) - when using too old date (older than 90 days)
    
    INTERNAL_ERROR_SERVER_HAS_NO_DATA(1004) - when server has problem and has no data about reference rates in memory (fatal error)
    
    NO_SUCH_CURRENCY(1005) - when using wrong currency

Error example response:

    "errorCode": 1005,
    "details": "Currency code is invalid"
  }

Note: When requested non-workday date (i.e. Sunday) the API returns closest entry with date before requested (in that case it would be Friday)
